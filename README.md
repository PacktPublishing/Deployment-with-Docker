# Deployment with Doker
This is the code repository for [Deployment with Doker](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/deployment-docker). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The course begins with a basic introduction to Docker, and explore our first Hello world! example. You then move on to Docker installation and more Hello world! examples on various platforms, and explore the Docker architecture and its major components such as the Docker Registry, Docker containers, and so on. Moving ahead, you will delve deeply into understanding Docker containers â€” one of the most important features in Docker. We also look at container and data management, customizing Docker images using Dockerfile, uploading images to the registry, and Dockerfile best practices. Along with learning Docker, you will also learn how Docker simplifies DevOps automation.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1 and 5 has commands explained in the chapter. Chapter 9 does not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
# Make sure we are fully up to date
RUN apt-get update -q && \
apt-get dist-upgrade -y && \
apt-get clean && \
apt-get autoclean
```
